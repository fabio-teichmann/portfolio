# Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Fabio and I am a software and systems architect. I am training myself to focus on big data and IoT applications in the future. 

I am a trained Data Scientist with a business heavy background and leadership experience. During the last couple of years, I worked mostly on defining, implementing, and maintaining data pipeline infrastructures that are compliant with governmenatal and audit requirements. This included substantial cross-team collaboration with technical and non-technical stakeholders. In this process I've built substantial domain knowledge and became a SME.

## 🎯 My current learning focus:
1. become a **cloud engineer** with focus on (big) data infrastructure and ML/AI applications
   - focus on **AWS** as the most widely used cloud provider
   - build relevant projects that focus on specific skills and the "bread-and-butter" services: VCP, IAM, EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, CloudFront, SQS, SNS
   - focus in **IaC** for automation and reproducability
2. learn about **Dev(Sec)Ops** workflows and best practices
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Containerization best practices and security
3. add another scripting language: **TypeScript**
