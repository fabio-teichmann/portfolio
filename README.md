# Welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Fabio — a hands-on Data and Cloud Architect with a strong foundation in data engineering and a clear trajectory toward infrastructure and platform engineering.

Originally trained as a Data Engineer with a business-focused background and leadership experience, I evolved into architecting robust, scalable, and auditable data platforms. My previous work has spanned cross-functional teams, demanding both deep technical engagement and strong stakeholder alignment — making me a domain SME in regulated, data-intensive environments.

## 🔁 From Data Architecture to Cloud & Platform Engineering

Over time, I realized that architectural impact requires mastery of the infrastructure layer. This has led me to focus on cloud-native tools, infrastructure automation, and DevOps best practices — bridging the gap between data architecture and modern platform engineering.

I've recently completed a hands-on cloud architecture course and am now actively applying this knowledge through targeted, production-grade projects.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Goals

I’m currently deepening my expertise with a focus on **Kubernetes** as the core control plane for modern infrastructure:

1. **Advance Kubernetes expertise** as the foundation for scalable platform engineering
   - Already proficient with Helm, containerization, and cluster operations
   - Now focusing on higher-order skills: GitOps (e.g., ArgoCD), K8s Operators, multi-cluster patterns, service meshes (Istio), and policy as code (OPA/Gatekeeper)
   - Treat Kubernetes not just as orchestration, but as a programmable substrate for infrastructure and application lifecycle management

2. **Refine and scale Dev(Sec)Ops automation**
   - Solid experience with CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Terraform, Helm, and deployment automation
   - Now expanding into GitOps workflows, secure multi-environment rollouts, drift detection, and declarative infra patterns
   - Prioritize reproducibility, environment parity, and team-ready infrastructure-as-code

3. **Target Roles**
   - Infrastructure Engineer
   - Platform Engineer
   - Cloud Engineer / Cloud Architect (with hands-on orientation)

My longer-term aim is to return to architecture — with a stronger execution layer — and deliver greater strategic value through platform thinking and infrastructure expertise.
