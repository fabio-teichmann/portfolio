# Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Fabio and I am an aspiring software and systems architect with focus on big data and IoT applications. 

I am a trained Data Scientist with a business heavy background and leadership experience. During the last couple of years, I worked mostly on defining, implementing, and maintaining data pipeline infrastructures that are compliant with governmenatal and audit requirements. This included substantial cross-team collaboration with technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

## 🎯 My current learning focus:
1. become a **cloud engineer** with focus on (big) data infrastructure and ML/AI applications
   - focus on **AWS** as the most widely used cloud provider
   - build relevant projects that focus on specific skills
   - focus in **IaC** and automatability
2. learn about DevOps workflows and best practices
3. add another scripting language: **TypeScript**
